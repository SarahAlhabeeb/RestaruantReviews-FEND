# Restaurant Reviews Project

#### Front End Nano-Degree

> Fifth project for Udacity Front-End Nano-Degree

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I converted a provided static webpage, that had lot of issues, to a mobile-ready web application. The static code was lacking accessibility so my job was to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for the users.

### How to run
- Download the zipped file or clone the project
- In a terminal, change directory to the project folder, then:
* For Python 2.x: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` 
* For Python 3.x: `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
- Visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` in the browser.
